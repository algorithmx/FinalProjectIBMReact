Final Project for Developing Front-End Apps with React
===

This is the course project for the course [Developing Front-End Apps with React](https://www.coursera.org/learn/developing-frontend-apps-with-react?specialization=ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer) on Coursera.

In this project, I followed [this initial repo](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/e-plantShopping.git) and [these instructions](https://cf-courses-data.static.labs.skills.network/Q9oXyc0bGF8VUe7bz8YxMA.md.html) to develop the Paradise Nursery Shopping Application.
